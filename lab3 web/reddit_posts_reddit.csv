**9:00 PDT - Champion Design AMA:** How do we approach champion and VGU development? What are our overall strategy and goals when we introduce new champions to the game? We’ll be taking your questions throughout the morning.

LeagueOfLegends,We're reversing those pacifist Ascension bans from yesterday...,2226,776,2017-08-09 23:18:06+00:00,"Hey all, 

Like u/draggles [mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6shlss/the_proof_of_riot_banning_the_ascension_pacifists/dlcw7cf/), we’ve been looking into these bans alongside the team over in Europe (where these games/bans occurred). The short version is that we goofed on these bans and are reversing them because these players weren’t intentionally feeding. We believe the pacifist strategy lines up with the “intent to win” policy we laid out earlier this year around other wacky approaches to the game like Support/Smite Singed and roaming Support Nunu. Check out [Meddler’s thoughts](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/05/dev-diary-meddler-on-unusual-playstyles-in-league/) on all that. 

As far as Ascension, the pacifist strategy is actually just fine, however it’s deeply unhealthy and unfun when players abuse it to stretch a game to absurd lengths in an effort to force opponents to surrender. We’ll be looking to update the game mode and reduce or remove the viability of this trolly version of the pacifist strategy.
